In a small village on the edge of this enchanted forest lived a brave and kindhearted young woman named Elara Elara lived with her father a skilled blacksmith and her younger brother Timmy Their mother had passed away when Elara was just a child and since then Elara had taken on the role of caring for her family Despite the challenges Elara remained cheerful and always dreamt of adventure

One sunny morning as Elara was tending to the garden a royal messenger arrived at their cottage He carried a proclamation from the king declaring that the princess Aurora had been captured by Morgana and was being held in the enchanted castle The king offered a great reward to anyone who could rescue his daughter

Elaras heart swelled with determination She knew she had to try and save the princess She bid her father and brother farewell and set off on her journey armed only with her courage and a small satchel of provisions

As Elara entered the enchanted forest she felt a mix of awe and trepidation The trees seemed to whisper secrets and the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers After several hours of walking she came across a clearing where a beautiful fairy named Liliana was trapped inside a golden cage

Please help me! Liliana pleaded Morgana trapped me here because I refused to help her with her dark magic

Elara without hesitation approached the cage and tried to open it However the lock was enchanted and would not budge Seeing her struggle Liliana said You must find the key It is hidden in the lair of the dragon who guards the enchanted forest

Elara nodded and continued her journey deeper into the forest As dusk fell she reached a cave where the dragon was said to reside Gathering her courage she entered the cave and found the dragon a massive creature with scales that glimmered like emeralds

I seek the key to free the fairy Liliana Elara declared boldly

The dragon whose name was Draconis eyed her with interest Many have come seeking treasures and rewards but few have come with such noble intent I will give you the key but first you must pass a test of bravery

Draconis led Elara to a chamber filled with illusions of her greatest fears Elara faced each one with unwavering courage refusing to let fear control her Pleased with her bravery Draconis handed her the key

Use this wisely Draconis advised And beware of Morganas trickery

With the key in hand Elara hurried back to the clearing and unlocked the golden cage freeing Liliana Grateful Liliana gifted Elara a magical amulet that would protect her from harm and guide her to the castle

Thank you Liliana Elara said I will use this amulet to save Princess Aurora

With Lilianas blessing Elara made her way to the ancient castle The amulet glowed lighting her path through the dark and twisted corridors Finally she reached the throne room where Morgana awaited her

So a brave soul has come to challenge me Morgana sneered You think you can save the princess

I will not let you harm the kingdom any longer Elara declared holding up the amulet

Morgana laughed and cast a spell but the amulet absorbed the dark magic protecting Elara With the amulets power Elara was able to counter Morganas spells and weaken her In a final act of desperation Morgana transformed into a monstrous creature and lunged at Elara But Elara with a swift and courageous move struck the sorceress with the amulet breaking the dark enchantment

Morganas form crumbled and her power dissipated freeing the castle and all who had been imprisoned by her magic Princess Aurora who had been held in a deep sleep awoke and embraced Elara

Thank you for saving me Aurora said gratefully You are truly a hero

Elara and Aurora returned to the kingdom where they were welcomed with joyous celebrations The king rewarded Elara with a chest of gold but Elara humbly requested that the reward be used to help the villagers and rebuild the kingdom

Elara returned home to her father and brother who were overjoyed at her safe return The village prospered under the protection of the kingdom and Elara became a legend known as the brave heroine who had saved the princess and defeated the wicked sorceress

As for Liliana and Draconis they became guardians of the enchanted forest ensuring it remained a place of wonder and magic Elara often visited them cherishing the friendships she had made on her incredible journey

Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment These harmful materials are called pollutants Pollutants can be natural such as volcanic ash They can also be created by human activity such as trash or runoff produced by factories Pollutants damage the quality of air water and land

Many things that are useful to people produce pollution Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife

All living things—from onecelled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earths supply of air and water When these resources are polluted all forms of life are threatened

Pollution is a global problem Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside pollution can spread to remote places where no people live For example pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

Air and water currents carry pollution Ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine pollutants far and wide Winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear reactor and scatter it around the world Smoke from a factory in one country drifts into another country

In the past visitors to Big Bend National Park in the US state of Texas could see 0 kilometers 0 miles across the vast landscape Now coalburning power plants in Texas and the neighboring state of Chihuahua Mexico have spewed so much pollution into the air that visitors to Big Bend can sometimes see only 0 kilometers 0 miles

The three major types of pollution are air pollution water pollution and land pollution

Air Pollution
Sometimes air pollution is visible A person can see dark smoke pour from the exhaust pipes of large trucks or factories for example More often however air pollution is invisible

Polluted air can be dangerous even if the pollutants are invisible It can make peoples eyes burn and make them have difficulty breathing It can also increase the risk of lung cancer

Sometimes air pollution kills quickly In  an accident at a pesticide plant in Bhopal India released a deadly gas into the air At least 000 people died within days Hundreds of thousands more were permanently injured

Natural disasters can also cause air pollution to increase quickly When volcanoes erupt they eject volcanic ash and gases into the atmosphere Volcanic ash can discolor the sky for months After the eruption of the Indonesian volcano of Krakatoa in  ash darkened the sky around the world The dimmer sky caused fewer crops to be harvested as far away as Europe and North America For years meteorologists tracked what was known as the equatorial smoke stream In fact this smoke stream was a jet stream a wind high in Earths atmosphere that Krakatoas air pollution made visible

Volcanic gases such as sulfur dioxide can kill nearby residents and make the soil infertile for years Mount Vesuvius a volcano in Italy famously erupted in  killing hundreds of residents of the nearby towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum Most victims of Vesuvius were not killed by lava or landslides caused by the eruption They were choked or asphyxiated by deadly volcanic gases

In  a toxic cloud developed over Lake Nyos Cameroon Lake Nyos sits in the crater of a volcano Though the volcano did not erupt it did eject volcanic gases into the lake The heated gases passed through the water of the lake and collected as a cloud that descended the slopes of the volcano and into nearby valleys As the toxic cloud moved across the landscape it killed birds and other organisms in their natural habitat This air pollution also killed thousands of cattle and as many as 00 people

Most air pollution is not natural however It comes from burning fossil fuels—coal oil and natural gas When gasoline is burned to power cars and trucks it produces carbon monoxide a colorless odorless gas The gas is harmful in high concentrations or amounts City traffic produces highly concentrated carbon monoxide

Cars and factories produce other common pollutants including nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons These chemicals react with sunlight to produce smog a thick fog or haze of air pollution The smog is so thick in Linfen China that people can seldom see the sun Smog can be brown or grayish blue depending on which pollutants are in it

Smog makes breathing difficult especially for children and older adults Some cities that suffer from extreme smog issue air pollution warnings The government of Hong Kong for example will warn people not to go outside or engage in strenuous physical activity such as running or swimming when smog is very thick


When air pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide mix with moisture they change into acids They then fall back to earth as acid rain Wind often carries acid rain far from the pollution source Pollutants produced by factories and power plants in Spain can fall as acid rain in Norway

Acid rain can kill all the trees in a forest It can also devastate lakes streams and other waterways When lakes become acidic fish cant survive In Sweden acid rain created thousands of dead lakes where fish no longer live

Acid rain also wears away marble and other kinds of stone It has erased the words on gravestones and damaged many historic buildings and monuments The Taj Mahal in Agra India was once gleaming white Years of exposure to acid rain has left it pale

Governments have tried to prevent acid rain by limiting the amount of pollutants released into the air In Europe and North America they have had some success but acid rain remains a major problem in the developing world especially Asia

Greenhouse gases are another source of air pollution Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane occur naturally in the atmosphere In fact they are necessary for life on Earth They absorb sunlight reflected from Earth preventing it from escaping into space By trapping heat in the atmosphere they keep Earth warm enough for people to live This is called the greenhouse effect

But human activities such as burning fossil fuels and destroying forests have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere This has increased the greenhouse effect and average temperatures across the globe are rising The decade that began in the year 000 was the warmest on record This increase in worldwide average temperatures caused in part by human activity is called global warming

Global warming is causing ice sheets and glaciers to melt The melting ice is causing sea levels to rise at a rate of two millimeters 00 inches per year The rising seas will eventually flood lowlying coastal regions Entire nations such as the islands of Maldives are threatened by this climate change

Global warming also contributes to the phenomenon of ocean acidification Ocean acidification is the process of ocean waters absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Fewer organisms can survive in warmer less salty waters The ocean food web is threatened as plants and animals such as coral fail to adapt to more acidic oceans

Scientists have predicted that global warming will cause an increase in severe storms It will also cause more droughts in some regions and more flooding in others

The change in average temperatures is already shrinking some habitats the regions where plants and animals naturally live Polar bears hunt seals from sea ice in the Arctic The melting ice is forcing polar bears to travel farther to find food and their numbers are shrinking

People and governments can respond quickly and effectively to reduce air pollution Chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons CFCs are a dangerous form of air pollution that governments worked to reduce in the 0s and 0s CFCs are found in gases that cool refrigerators in foam products and in aerosol cans

CFCs damage the ozone layer a region in Earths upper atmosphere The ozone layer protects Earth by absorbing much of the suns harmful ultraviolet radiation When people are exposed to more ultraviolet radiation they are more likely to develop skin cancer eye diseases and other illnesses

In the 0s scientists noticed that the ozone layer over Antarctica was thinning This is often called the ozone hole No one lives permanently in Antarctica But Australia the home of more than  million people lies at the edge of the hole In the 0s the Australian government began an effort to warn people of the dangers of too much sun Many countries including the United States now severely limit the production of CFCs

Water Pollution
Some polluted water looks muddy smells bad and has garbage floating in it Some polluted water looks clean but is filled with harmful chemicals you cant see or smell

Polluted water is unsafe for drinking and swimming Some people who drink polluted water are exposed to hazardous chemicals that may make them sick years later Others consume bacteria and other tiny aquatic organisms that cause disease The United Nations estimates that 000 children die every day from drinking dirty water

Sometimes polluted water harms people indirectly They get sick because the fish that live in polluted water are unsafe to eat They have too many pollutants in their flesh

There are some natural sources of water pollution Oil and natural gas for example can leak into oceans and lakes from natural underground sources These sites are called petroleum seeps The worlds largest petroleum seep is the Coal Oil Point Seep off the coast of the US state of California The Coal Oil Point Seep releases so much oil that tar balls wash up on nearby beaches Tar balls are small sticky pieces of pollution that eventually decompose in the ocean


Human activity also contributes to water pollution Chemicals and oils from factories are sometimes dumped or seep into waterways These chemicals are called runoff Chemicals in runoff can create a toxic environment for aquatic life Runoff can also help create a fertile environment for cyanobacteria also called bluegreen algae Cyanobacteria reproduce rapidly creating a harmful algal bloom HAB Harmful algal blooms prevent organisms such as plants and fish from living in the ocean They are associated with dead zones in the worlds lakes and rivers places where little life exists below surface water

Mining and drilling can also contribute to water pollution Acid mine drainage AMD is a major contributor to pollution of rivers and streams near coal mines Acid helps miners remove coal from the surrounding rocks The acid is washed into streams and rivers where it reacts with rocks and sand It releases chemical sulfur from the rocks and sand creating a river rich in sulfuric acid Sulfuric acid is toxic to plants fish and other aquatic organisms Sulfuric acid is also toxic to people making rivers polluted by AMD dangerous sources of water for drinking and hygiene

Oil spills are another source of water pollution In April 00 the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico causing oil to gush from the ocean floor In the following months hundreds of millions of gallons of oil spewed into the gulf waters The spill produced large plumes of oil under the sea and an oil slick on the surface as large as 000 square kilometers 00 square miles The oil slick coated wetlands in the US states of Louisiana and Mississippi killing marsh plants and aquatic organisms such as crabs and fish Birds such as pelicans became coated in oil and were unable to fly or access food More than two million animals died as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill

Buried chemical waste can also pollute water supplies For many years people disposed of chemical wastes carelessly not realizing its dangers In the 0s people living in the Love Canal area in Niagara Falls New York suffered from extremely high rates of cancer and birth defects It was discovered that a chemical waste dump had poisoned the areas water In  00 families living in Love Canal had to abandon their homes

If not disposed of properly radioactive waste from nuclear power plants can escape into the environment Radioactive waste can harm living things and pollute the water

Sewage that has not been properly treated is a common source of water pollution Many cities around the world have poor sewage systems and sewage treatment plants Delhi the capital of India is home to more than  million people More than half the sewage and other waste produced in the city are dumped into the Yamuna River This pollution makes the river dangerous to use as a source of water for drinking or hygiene It also reduces the rivers fishery resulting in less food for the local community

A major source of water pollution is fertilizer used in agriculture Fertilizer is material added to soil to make plants grow larger and faster Fertilizers usually contain large amounts of the elements nitrogen and phosphorus which help plants grow Rainwater washes fertilizer into streams and lakes There the nitrogen and phosphorus cause cyanobacteria to form harmful algal blooms

Rain washes other pollutants into streams and lakes It picks up animal waste from cattle ranches Cars drip oil onto the street and rain carries it into storm drains which lead to waterways such as rivers and seas Rain sometimes washes chemical pesticides off of plants and into streams Pesticides can also seep into groundwater the water beneath the surface of the Earth

Heat can pollute water Power plants for example produce a huge amount of heat Power plants are often located on rivers so they can use the water as a coolant Cool water circulates through the plant absorbing heat The heated water is then returned to the river Aquatic creatures are sensitive to changes in temperature Some fish for example can only live in cold water Warmer river temperatures prevent fish eggs from hatching Warmer river water also contributes to harmful algal blooms

Another type of water pollution is simple garbage The Citarum River in Indonesia for example has so much garbage floating in it that you cannot see the water Floating trash makes the river difficult to fish in Aquatic animals such as fish and turtles mistake trash such as plastic bags for food Plastic bags and twine can kill many ocean creatures Chemical pollutants in trash can also pollute the water making it toxic for fish and people who use the river as a source of drinking water The fish that are caught in a polluted river often have high levels of chemical toxins in their flesh People absorb these toxins as they eat the fish

Garbage also fouls the ocean Many plastic bottles and other pieces of trash are thrown overboard from boats The wind blows trash out to sea Ocean currents carry plastics and other floating trash to certain places on the globe where it cannot escape The largest of these areas called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean According to some estimates this garbage patch is the size of Texas The trash is a threat to fish and seabirds which mistake the plastic for food Many of the plastics are covered with chemical pollutants

Land Pollution
Many of the same pollutants that foul the water also harm the land Mining sometimes leaves the soil contaminated with dangerous chemicals

Pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural fields are blown by the wind They can harm plants animals and sometimes people Some fruits and vegetables absorb the pesticides that help them grow When people consume the fruits and vegetables the pesticides enter their bodies Some pesticides can cause cancer and other diseases

A pesticide called DDT dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was once commonly used to kill insects especially mosquitoes In many parts of the world mosquitoes carry a disease called malaria which kills a million people every year Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize for his understanding of how DDT can control insects and other pests DDT is responsible for reducing malaria in places such as Taiwan and Sri Lanka

In  American biologist Rachel Carson wrote a book called Silent Spring which discussed the dangers of DDT She argued that it could contribute to cancer in humans She also explained how it was destroying bird eggs which caused the number of bald eagles brown pelicans and ospreys to drop In  the United States banned the use of DDT Many other countries also banned it But DDT didnt disappear entirely Today many governments support the use of DDT because it remains the most effective way to combat malaria

Trash is another form of land pollution Around the world paper cans glass jars plastic products and junked cars and appliances mar the landscape Litter makes it difficult for plants and other producers in the food web to create nutrients Animals can die if they mistakenly eat plastic

Garbage often contains dangerous pollutants such as oils chemicals and ink These pollutants can leech into the soil and harm plants animals and people

Inefficient garbage collection systems contribute to land pollution Often the garbage is picked up and brought to a dump or landfill Garbage is buried in landfills Sometimes communities produce so much garbage that their landfills are filling up They are running out of places to dump their trash

A massive landfill near Quezon City Philippines was the site of a land pollution tragedy in 000 Hundreds of people lived on the slopes of the Quezon City landfill These people made their living from recycling and selling items found in the landfill However the landfill was not secure Heavy rains caused a trash landslide killing  people

Sometimes landfills are not completely sealed off from the land around them Pollutants from the landfill leak into the earth in which they are buried Plants that grow in the earth may be contaminated and the herbivores that eat the plants also become contaminated So do the predators that consume the herbivores This process where a chemical builds up in each level of the food web is called bioaccumulation

Pollutants leaked from landfills also leak into local groundwater supplies There the aquatic food web from microscopic algae to fish to predators such as sharks or eagles can suffer from bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals

Some communities do not have adequate garbage collection systems and trash lines the side of roads In other places garbage washes up on beaches Kamilo Beach in the US state of Hawaii is littered with plastic bags and bottles carried in by the tide The trash is dangerous to ocean life and reduces economic activity in the area Tourism is Hawaiis largest industry Polluted beaches discourage tourists from investing in the areas hotels restaurants and recreational activities

Some cities incinerate or burn their garbage Incinerating trash gets rid of it but it can release dangerous heavy metals and chemicals into the air So while trash incinerators can help with the problem of land pollution they sometimes add to the problem of air pollution

Reducing Pollution
Around the world people and governments are making efforts to combat pollution Recycling for instance is becoming more common In recycling trash is processed so its useful materials can be used again Glass aluminum cans and many types of plastic can be melted and reused Paper can be broken down and turned into new paper

Recycling reduces the amount of garbage that ends up in landfills incinerators and waterways Austria and Switzerland have the highest recycling rates These nations recycle between 0 and 0 percent of their garbage The United States recycles about 0 percent of its garbage

Governments can combat pollution by passing laws that limit the amount and types of chemicals factories and agribusinesses are allowed to use The smoke from coalburning power plants can be filtered People and businesses that illegally dump pollutants into the land water and air can be fined for millions of dollars Some government programs such as the Superfund program in the United States can force polluters to clean up the sites they polluted

International agreements can also reduce pollution The Kyoto Protocol a United Nations agreement to limit the emission of greenhouse gases has been signed by  countries The United States the worlds secondlargest producer of greenhouse gases did not sign the agreement Other countries such as China the worlds largest producer of greenhouse gases have not met their goals

Still many gains have been made In  the Cuyahoga River in the US state of Ohio was so clogged with oil and trash that it caught on fire The fire helped spur the Clean Water Act of  This law limited what pollutants could be released into water and set standards for how clean water should be Today the Cuyahoga River is much cleaner Fish have returned to regions of the river where they once could not survive

But even as some rivers are becoming cleaner others are becoming more polluted As countries around the world become wealthier some forms of pollution increase Countries with growing economies usually need more power plants which produce more pollutants

Reducing pollution requires environmental political and economic leadership Developed nations must work to reduce and recycle their materials while developing nations must work to strengthen their economies without destroying the environment Developed and developing countries must work together toward the common goal of protecting the environment for future use

Certainly! India experiences a diverse cycle of seasons throughout the year Winter December to February brings cool temperatures clear skies and gentle northeast trade breezes The summer months March to June are scorching hot with some regions reaching up to 0°C The monsoon season June to September brings heavy rains crucial for agriculture but also poses risks of flooding and landslides Autumn October to November sees changing leaves and cooler weather while the prewinter period December to January offers milder temperatures and shorter days These seasons shape Indias culture economy and daily life
Certainly! Heres a simple paragraph about the rainy season:

India is known for its rainy season From June to September we experience the monsoon The southwest winds bring clouds and torrential rain falls in different parts of the country While Rajasthan gets the least rain Meghalaya receives the highest The Himalayan Ranges play a role by stopping moisturecontaining winds which then transform into rain clouds Monsoon winds from the oceans bring water to various states During this season our atmosphere feels cooler and dark clouds and lightning become common Farmers prepare their fields and rainwater fills ponds rivers and streams The environment turns greener but excessive rainfall can cause water logging Overall the rainy season is crucial for crops nature and our planet

Certainly! Lets delve deeper into our remarkable planet Earth

Geology and Structure:
Earths core consists of a solid inner core mostly iron and nickel and a liquid outer core Surrounding this is the mantle a semisolid layer responsible for tectonic movements The crust where we live is a thin layer compared to the rest It comprises continents and ocean floors

Atmosphere:
Earths atmosphere extends about 00 miles above its surface It contains essential gases like nitrogen % and oxygen % The ozone layer shields us from harmful UV radiation

Hydrosphere:
Oceans cover approximately % of Earths surface They regulate climate absorb heat and support diverse marine life Freshwater exists in rivers lakes glaciers and underground aquifers

Biosphere:
Life thrives across Earths varied ecosystems—forests grasslands deserts and oceans From microscopic organisms to majestic animals the biosphere sustains an intricate web of life Our actions impact this delicate balance emphasizing the need for conservation and responsible stewardship 
If the cows didnt come home at the right time Binya would be sent to fetch them sometimes her brother Bijju went with her but these days he was busy preparing for his exams and didnt have time to help with the cows Binya liked being on her own and sometimes she allowed the cows to lead her into some distant valley and then they would all be late coming home The cows preferred having Binya with them because she let them wander Bijju pulled them by their tails if they went too far Binya belonged to the mountains to this part of the Himalayas known as Garhwal Dark forests and lonely hilltops held no terrors for her It was only when she was in the markettown jostled by the crowds in the bazaar that she felt rather nervous and lost The town five miles from the village was also a pleasure resort for tourists from all over India Binya was probably ten She may have been nine or even eleven she couldnt be sure because no one in the village kept birthdays; but her mother told her shed been born during a winter when the snow had come up to the windows and that was just over ten years ago wasnt it Two years later her father had died; but his passing had made no difference to their way of life They had three tiny terraced fields on the side of the mountain and they grew potatoes onions ginger beans mustard and maize: not enough to sell in the town but enough to live on Like most mountain girls Binya was quite sturdy fair of skin with pink cheeks and dark eyes and her black hair tied in a pigtail She wore pretty glass bangles on her wrists and a necklace of glass beads From the necklace hung a leopards claw It was a lucky charm and Binya always wore it Bijju had one too only his was attached to a string Binyas full name was Binyadevi and Bijjus real name was vijay but everyone called them Binya and Bijju Binya was two years younger than her brother She had stopped calling for Neelu; she had heard the cowbells tinkling and knew the cows hadnt gone far Singing to herself she walked over fallen pine needles into the forest glade on the spur of the hill She heard voices laughter the clatter of plates and cups; and stepping through the trees she came upon a party of picnickers They were holidaymakers from the plains The women were dressed in bright saris the men wore light summer shirts and the children had pretty new clothes Binya standing in the shadows between the trees went unnoticed; and for some time she watched the picnickers admiring their clothes listening to their unfamiliar accents and gazing rather hungrily at the sight of all their food And then her gaze came to rest on a bright blue umbrella a frilly thing for women which lay open on the grass beside its owner Now Binya had seen umbrellas before and her mother had a big black umbrella which nobody used any more because the fieldrats had eaten holes in it but this was the first time Binya had seen such a small dainty colourful umbrella; and she fell in love with it The umbrella was like a flower a great blue flower that had sprung up on the dry brown hillside She moved forward a few paces so that she could see the umbrella better As she came out of the shadows into the sunlight the picnickers saw her Hello look whos here! exclaimed the older of the two women A little village girl! Isnt she pretty remarked the other But how torn and dirty her clothes are! it did not seem to bother them that Binya could hear and understand everything they said about her Theyre very poor in the hills said one of the men Then lets give her something to eat And the older woman beckoned to Binya to come closer Hesitantly nervously Binya approached the group Normally she would have turned and fled; but the attraction was the pretty blue umbrella It had cast a spell over her drawing her forward almost against her will Whats that on her neck asked the younger woman A necklace of sorts Its a pendant—see theres a claw hanging from it! Its a tigers claw said the man beside her He had never seen a tigers claw A lucky charm These people wear them to keep away evil spirits He looked to Binya for confirmation but Binya said nothing Oh I want one too! said the woman who was obviously his wife You cant get them in shops Buy hers then Give her two or three rupees shes sure to need the money The man looking slightly embarrassed but anxious to please his young wife produced a tworupee note and offered it to Binya indicating that he wanted the pendant in exchange Binya put her hand to the necklace half afraid that the excited woman would snatch it away from her Solemnly she shook her head The man then showed her a fiverupee note but again Binya shook her head How silly she is! exclaimed the young woman It may not be hers to sell said the man But ill try again How much do you want—what can we give you And he waved his hand towards the picnic things scattered about on the grass Without any hesitation Binya pointed to the umbrella My umbrella! exclaimed the young woman She wants my umbrella What cheek! Well you want her pendant dont you Thats different Is it The man and his wife were beginning to quarrel with each other Ill ask her to go away said the older woman Were making such fools of ourselves But I want the pendant! cried the other petulantly And then on an impulse she picked up the umbrella and held it out to Binya Here take the umbrella! Binya removed her necklace and held it out to the young woman who immediately placed it round her own neck Then Binya took the umbrella and held it up It did not look so small in her hands; in fact it was just the right size She had forgotten about the picnickers who were busy examining the pendant She turned the blue umbrella this way and that; looked through the bright blue silk at the pulsating sun; and then still keeping it open turned and disappeared into the forest glade
Whenever Binya went out—whether it was to graze the cows or fetch water from the spring or carry milk to the little tea shop on the Tehri road—she took the umbrella with her That patch of skyblue silk could always be seen on the hillside Old Ram Bharosa Ram the Trustworthy kept the tea shop on the Tehri road It was a dusty unmetalled road Once a day the Tehri bus stopped near his shop and passengers got down to sip hot tea or drink a glass of curds He kept a few bottles of Cocacola too; but as there was no ice the bottles got hot in the sun and so were seldom opened He also kept sweets and toffees and when Binya or Bijju had a few coins to spare they would spend them at the shop It was only a mile from the village Ram Bharosa was astonished to see Binyas blue umbrella What have you there Binya he asked Binya gave the umbrella a twirl and smiled at Ram Bharosa She was always ready with her smile and would willingly have lent it to anyone who was feeling unhappy Thats a ladys umbrella said Ram Bharosa Thats only for MemSahibs Where did you get it Someone gave it to me—for my necklace You exchanged it for your lucky claw! Binya nodded But what do you need it for The sun isnt hot enough—and it isnt meant for the rain Its just a pretty thing for rich ladies to play with! Binya nodded and smiled again Ram Bharosa was quite right; it was just a beautiful plaything And that was exactly why she had fallen in love with it I have an idea said the shopkeeper Its no use to you that umbrella Why not sell it to me Ill give you five rupees for it Its worth fifteen said Binya Well then Ill give you ten Binya laughed and shook her head Twelve rupees said Ram Bharosa but without much hope Binya placed a fivepaise coin on the counter I came for a toffee she said Ram Bharosa pulled at his drooping whiskers gave Binya a wry look and placed a toffee in the palm of her hand He watched Binya as she walked away along the dusty road The blue umbrella held him fascinated and he stared after it until it was out of sight The villagers used this road to go to the markettown Some used the bus; a few rode on mules; most people walked Today everyone on the road turned their heads to stare at the girl with the bright blue umbrella Binya sat down in the shade of a pine tree The umbrella still open lay beside her She cradled her head in her arms and presently she dozed off It was that kind of day sleepily warm and summery And while she slept a wind sprang up It came quietly swishing gently through the trees humming softly Then it was joined by other random gusts bustling over the tops of the mountains The trees shook their heads and came to life The wind fanned Binyas cheeky The umbrella stirred on the grass The wind grew stronger picking up dead leaves and sending them spinning and swirling through the air It got into the umbrella and began to drag it over the grass Suddenly it lifted the umbrella and carried it about six feet from the sleeping girl The sound woke Binya She was on her feet immediately and then she was leaping down the steep slope But just as she was within reach of the umbrella the wind picked it up again and carried it further downhill Binya set off in pursuit The wind was in a wicked playful mood It would leave the umbrella alone for a few moments; but as soon as Binya came near it would pick up the umbrella again and send it bouncing floating dancing away from her The hill grew steeper Binya knew that after twenty yards it would fall away in a precipice She ran faster And the wind ran with her ahead of her and the blue umbrella stayed up with the wind A fresh gust picked it up and carried it to the very edge of the cliff There it balanced for a few seconds before toppling over out of sight Binya ran to the edge of the cliff Going down on her hands and knees she peered down the cliffface About a hundred feet below a small stream rushed between great boulders Hardly anything grew on the cliffface—just a few stunted bushes and halfway down a wild cherry tree growing crookedly out of the rocks and hanging across the chasm The umbrella had stuck in the cherry tree Binya didnt hesitate She may have been timid with strangers but she was at home on a hillside She stuck her bare leg over the edge of the cliff and began climbing down she kept her face to the hillside feeling her way with her feet only changing her handhold when she knew her feet were secure Sometimes she held on to the thorny bilberry bushes but she did not trust the other plants which came away very easily Loose stones rattled down the cliff Once on their way the stones did not stop until they reached the bottom of the hill; and they took other stones with them so that there was soon a cascade of stones and Binya had to be very careful not to start a landslide As agile as a mountaingoat she did not take more than five minutes to reach the crooked cherry tree But the most difficult task remained She had to crawl along the trunk of the tree which stood out at right angles from the cliff Only by doing this could she reach the trapped umbrella Binya felt no fear when climbing trees She was proud of the fact that she could climb them as well as Bijju Gripping the rough cherry bark with her toes and using her knees as leverage she crawled along the trunk of the projecting tree until she was almost within reach of the umbrella She noticed with dismay that the blue cloth was torn in a couple of places She looked down; and it was only then that she felt afraid She was right over the chasm balanced precariously about eighty feet above the boulderstrewn stream Looking down she felt quite dizzy Her hands shook and the tree shook too If she slipped now there was only one direction in which she could fall—down down into the depths of that dark and shadowy ravine There was only one thing to do; concentrate on the patch of blue just a couple of feet away from her She did not look down or up but straight ahead; and willing herself forward she managed to reach the umbrella She could not crawl back with it in her hands So after dislodging it from the forked branch in which it had stuck she let it fall still open into the ravine below Cushioned by the wind the umbrella floated serenely downwards landing in a thicket of nettles Binya crawled back along the trunk of the cherry tree Twenty minutes later she emerged from the nettle clump her precious umbrella held aloft She had nettle stings all over her legs but she was hardly aware of the smarting She was as immune to nettles as Bijju was to bees
But now if a bee stung him he felt nothing at all: he had been immunised for life! He was on his way home from school It was two oclock and he hadnt eaten since six in the morning Fortunately the Kingora bushes—the bilberries—were in fruit and already Bijjus lips were stained purple with the juice of the wild sour fruit He didnt have any money to spend at Ram Bharosas shop but he stopped there anyway to look at the sweets in their glass jars And what will you have today asked Ram Bharosa No money said Bijju You can pay me later Bijju shook his head Some of his friends had taken sweets on credit and at the end of the month they had found theyd eaten more sweets than they could possibly pay for! As a result theyd had to hand over to Ram Bharosa some of their most treasured possessions—such as a curved knife for cutting grass or a small hand axe or a jar for pickles or a pair of earrings—and these had become the shopkeepers possessions and were kept by him or sold in his shop Ram Bharosa had set his heart on having Binyas blue umbrella and so naturally he was anxious to give credit to either of the children; but so far neither had fallen into the trap Bijju moved on his mouth full of Kingora berries Half way home he saw Binya with the cows It was late evening and the sun had gone down but Binya still had the umbrella open The two small rents had been stitched up by her mother Bijju gave his sister a handful of berries She handed him the umbrella while she ate the berries You can have the umbrella until we get home she said It was her way of rewarding Bijju for bringing her the wild fruit Calling neelu! Gori! Binya and Bijju set out for home followed at some distance by the cows It was dark before they reached the village but Bijju still had the umbrella open Most of the people in the village were a little envious of Binyas blue umbrella No one else had ever possessed one like it The schoolmasters wife thought it was quite wrong for a poor cultivators daughter to have such a fine umbrella while she a secondclass BA had to make do with an ordinary black one Her husband offered to have their old umbrella dyed blue; she gave him a scornful look and loved him a little less than before The Pujari who looked after the temple announced that he would buy a multicoloured umbrella the next time he was in the town A few days later he returned looking annoyed and grumbling that they werent available except in Delhi Most people consoled themselves by saying that Binyas pretty umbrella wouldnt keep out the rain if it rained heavily; that it would shrivel in the sun if the sun was fierce; that it would collapse in a wind if the wind was strong; that it would attract lightning if lightning fell near it; and that it would prove unlucky if there was any illluck going about Secretly everyone admired it Unlike the adults the children didnt have to pretend They were full of praise for the umbrella It was so light so pretty so bright a blue! And it was just the right size for Binya They knew that if they said nice things about the umbrella Binya would smile and give it to them to hold for a little while—just a very little while! Soon it was the time of the monsoon Big black clouds kept piling up and thunder rolled over the hills Binya sat on the hillside all afternoon waiting for the rain As soon as the first big drop of rain came down she raised the umbrella over her head More drops big ones came pattering down She could see them through the umbrella silk as they broke against the cloth And then there was a cloudburst and it was like standing under a waterfall The umbrella wasnt really a rainumbrella but it held up bravely Only Binyas feet got wet Rods of rain fell around her in a curtain of shivered glass Everywhere on the hillside people were scurrying for shelter Some made for a charcoalburners hut; others for a muleshed or Ram Bharosas shop Binya was the only one who didnt run This was what shed been waiting for—rain on her umbrella—and she wasnt in a hurry to go home She didnt mind getting her feet wet The cows didnt mind getting wet either Presently she found Bijju sheltering in a cave He would have enjoyed getting wet but he had his school books with him and he couldnt afford to let them get spoilt When he saw Binya he came out of the cave and shared the umbrella He was a head taller than his sister so he had to hold the umbrella for her while she held his books The cows had been left far behind Neelu Neelu! called Binya Gori! called Bijju When their mother saw them sauntering home through the driving rain she called out: Binya! Bijju! Hurry up and bring the cows in! What are you doing out there in the rain Just testing the umbrella said Bijju
Ferns sprang up on walls and treetrunks Giant lilies reared up like leopards from the tall grass A white mist coiled and uncoiled as it floated up from the valley It was a beautiful season except for the leeches Every day Binya came home with a couple of leeches fastened to the flesh of her bare legs They fell off by themselves just as soon as theyd had their thimbleful of blood; but you didnt know they were on you until they fell off; and then later the skin became very sore and itchy Some of the older people still believed that to be bled by leeches was a remedy for various ailments Whenever Ram Bharosa had a headache he applied a leech to his throbbing temple Three days of incessant rain had flooded out a number of small animals who lived in holes in the ground Binyas mother suddenly found the roof full of field rats She had to drive them out; they ate too much of her storedup wheat flour and rice Bijju liked lifting up large rocks to disturb the scorpions who were sleeping beneath And snakes came out to bask in the sun Binya had just crossed the small stream at the bottom of the hill when she saw something gliding out of the bushes and coming towards her It was a long black snake A clatter of loose stones frightened it Seeing the girl in its way it rose up hissing prepared to strike The forked tongue darted out the venomous head lunged at Binya Binyas umbrella was open as usual She thrust it forward between herself and the snake and the snakes hard snout thudded twice against the strong silk of the umbrella The reptile then turned and slithered away over the wet rocks disappearing in a clump of ferns Binya forgot about the cows and ran all the way home to tell her mother how she had been saved by the umbrella Bijju had to put away his books and go out to fetch the cows He carried a stout stick in case he met with any snakes First the summer sun and now the endless rain meant that the umbrella was beginning to fade a little From a bright blue it had changed to a light blue But it was still a pretty thing and tougher than it looked and Ram Bharosa still desired it He did not want to sell it; he wanted to own it He was probably the richest man in the area—so why shouldnt he have a blue umbrella Not a day passed without his getting a glimpse of Binya and the umbrella; and the more he saw the umbrella the more he wanted it The schools closed during the monsoon but this didnt mean that Bijju could sit at home doing nothing Neelu and Gori were providing more milk than was required at home so Binyas mother was able to sell a kilo of milk every day: half a kilo to the schoolmaster and half a kilo at reduced rate to the temple Pujari Bijju had to deliver the milk every morning Ram Bharosa had asked Bijju to work in his shop during the holidays but Bijju didnt have time; he had to help his mother with the ploughing and the transplanting of the riceseedlings So Ram Bharosa employed a boy from the next village a boy called Rajaram He did all the washingup and ran various errands He went to the same school as Bijju but the two boys were not friends One day as Binya passed the shop twirling her blue umbrella Rajaram noticed that his employer gave a deep sigh and began muttering to himself Whats the matter Babuji asked the boy Oh nothing said Ram Bharosa Its just a sickness that has come upon me And its all due to that girl Binya and her wretched umbrella Why what has she done to you Refused to sell me her umbrella! Theres pride for you And I offered her ten rupees Perhaps if you gave her twelve … But it isnt new any longer It isnt worth eight rupees now All the same Id like to have it You wouldnt make a profit on it said Rajaram Its not the profit Im after wretch! Its the thing itself Its the beauty of it! And what would you do with it Babuji You dont visit anyone—youre seldom out of your shop Of what use would it be to you Of what use is a poppy in a cornfield Of what use is a rainbow Of what use are you numbskull Wretch! I too have a soul I want the umbrella because— because I want its beauty to be mine! Rajaram put the kettle on to boil began dusting the counter all the time muttering: Im as useful as an umbrella and then after a short period of intense thought said: What will you give me Babuji if i get the umbrella for you What do you mean asked the old man You know what i mean What will you give me You mean to steal it dont you you wretch What a delightful child you are! Im glad youre not my son or my enemy But look—everyone will know it has been stolen and then how will I be able to show off with it You will have to gaze upon it in secret said Rajaram with a chuckle Or take it into Tehri and have it coloured red! Thats your problem But tell me Babuji do you want it badly enough to pay me three rupees for stealing it without being seen Ram Bharosa gave the boy a long sad look Youre a sharp boy he said Youll come to a bad end Ill give you two rupees Three said the boy Two said the old man You dont really want it i can see that said the boy Wretch! said the old man Evil one! Darkener of my doorstep! Fetch me the umbrella and Ill give you three rupees
The hill people didnt think much of porcupinequills but far away in southern India the quills were valued as charms and sold at a rupee each So Ram Bharosa paid a tenth of a rupee for each quill brought to him and he in turn sold the quills at a profit to a trader from the plains Binya had already found five quills and she knew thered be more in the long grass For once shed put her umbrella down She had to put it aside if she was to search the ground thoroughly It was Rajarams chance Hed been following Binya for some time concealing himself behind trees and rocks creeping closer whenever she became absorbed in her search He was anxious that she should not see him and be able to recognize him later He waited until Binya had wandered some distance from the umbrella Then running forward at a crouch he seized the open umbrella and dashed off with it But Rajaram had very big feet Binya heard his heavy footsteps and turned just in tune to see him as he disappeared between the trees She cried out dropped the porcupinequills and gave chase Binya was swift and surefooted but Rajaram had a long stride All the same he made the mistake of running downhill A longlegged person is much faster going up hill than down Binya reached the edge of the forest glade in time to see the thief scrambling down the path to the stream He had closed the umbrella so that it would not hinder his flight Binya was beginning to gain on the boy He kept to the path while she simply slid and leapt down the steep hillside Near the bottom of the hill the path began to straighten out and it was here that the longlegged boy began to forge ahead again Bijju was coming home from another direction He had a bundle of sticks which hed collected for the kitchen fire As he reached the path he saw Binya rushing down the hill as though all the mountainspirits in Garhwal were after her Whats wrong he called Why are you running Binya paused only to point at the fleeing Rajaram My umbrella! she cried He has stolen it! Bijju dropped his bundle of sticks and ran after his sister When he reached her side he said Ill soon catch him! and went sprinting away over the lush green grass He was fresh and he was soon well ahead of Binya and gaining on the thief Rajaram was crossing the shallow stream when Bijju caught up with him Rajaram was the taller boy but Bijju was much stronger He flung himself at the thief caught him by the legs and brought him down in the water Rajaram got to his feet and tried to drag himself away; but Bijju still had him by a leg Rajaram overbalanced and came down with a great splash He had let the umbrella fall It began to float away on the current Just then Binya arrived flushed and breathless and went dashing into the stream after the umbrella Meanwhile a tremendous fight was taking place Locked in fierce combat the two boys swayed together on a rock tumbled on to the sand rolled over and over the pebbled bank until they were again threshing about in the shallows of the stream The magpies bulbuls and other birds were disturbed and flew away with cries of alarm Covered with mud gasping and spluttering the boys groped for each other in the water After five minutes of frenzied struggle Bijju emerged victorious Rajaram lay flat on his back on the sand exhausted while Bijju sat astride him pinning him down with his arms and legs Let me get up! gasped Rajaram let me go—i dont want your useless umbrella! Then why did you take it demanded Bijju Come on—tell me why! It was that skinflint Ram Bharosa said Rajaram He told me to get it for him He said if I didnt fetch it Id lose my job
early october the rains were coming to an end The leeches disappeared The ferns turned yellow and the sunlight on the green hills was mellow and golden like the limes on the small tree in front of Binyas home Bijjus days were happy ones as he came home from school munching on roasted corn Binyas umbrella had turned a pale milky blue and was patched in several places but it was still the prettiest umbrella in the village and she still carried it with her wherever she went The cold cruel winter wasnt far off but somehow October seems longer than other months because it is a kind month: the grass is good to he upon the breeze is warm and gentle and pinescented That October everyone seemed contented— everyone that is except Ram Bharosa The old man had by now given up all hope of ever possessing Binyas umbrella He wished he had never set eyes on it Because of the umbrella he had suffered the tortures of greed the despair of loneliness Because of the umbrella people had stopped corning to his shop! Ever since it had become known that Ram Bharosa had tried to have the umbrella stolen the village people had turned against him They stopped trusting the old man instead of buying their soap and tea and matches from his shop they preferred to walk an extra mile to the shops near the Tehri bus stand Who would have dealings with a man who had sold his soul for an umbrella The children taunted him twisted his name around From Ram the Trustworthy he became Trusty Umbrella Thief The old man sat alone in his empty shop listening to the eternal hissing of his kettle and wondering if anyone would ever again step in for a glass of tea Ram Bharosa had lost his own appetite and ate and drank very little There was no money corning in He had his savings in a bank in Tehri but it was a terrible thing to have to dip into them! To save money he had dismissed the blundering Rajaram So he was left without any company The roof leaked and the wind got in through the corrugated tin sheets but Ram Bharosa didnt care Bijju and Binya passed his shop almost every day Bijju went by with a loud but tuneless whistle He was one of the worlds whistlers; cares rested lightly on his shoulders But strangely enough Binya crept quietly past the shop looking the other way almost as though she was in some way responsible for the misery of Ram Bharosa She kept reasoning with herself telling herself that the umbrella was her very own and that she couldnt help it if others were jealous of it But had she loved the umbrella too much Had it mattered more to her than people mattered She couldnt help feeling that in a small way she was the cause of the sad look on Ram Bharosas face His face is a yard long said Bijju and the ruinous condition of his shop It was all due to his own greed no doubt; but she didnt want him to feel too bad about what hed done because it made her feel bad about herself; and so she closed the umbrella whenever she came near the shop opening it again only when she was out of sight One day towards the end of October when she had ten paise in her pocket she entered the shop and asked the old man for a toffee She was Ram Bharosas first customer in almost two weeks He looked suspiciously at the girl Had she come to taunt him to flaunt the umbrella in his face She had placed her coin on the counter Perhaps it was a bad coin Ram Bharosa picked it up and bit it; he held it up to the light; he rang it on the ground It was a good coin He gave Binya the toffee Binya had already left the shop when Ram Bharosa saw the closed umbrella lying on his counter There it was the blue umbrella he had always wanted within his grasp at last! He had only to hide it at the back of his shop and no one would know that he had it no one could prove that Binya had left it behind He stretched out his trembling bony hand and took the umbrella by the handle He pressed it open He stood beneath it in the dark shadows of his shop where no sun or rain could ever touch it But Im never in the sun or in the rain he said aloud Of what use is an umbrella to me And he hurried outside and ran after Binya Binya Binya! he shouted Binya youve left your umbrella behind! He wasnt used to running but he caught up with her held out the umbrella saying you forgot it—the umbrella! In that moment it belonged to both of them But Binya didnt take the umbrella She shook her head and said you keep it I dont need it any more But its such a pretty umbrella! protested Ram Bharosa its the best umbrella in the village I know said Binya But an umbrella isnt everything And she left the old man holding the umbrella and went tripping down the road and there was nothing between her and the bright blue sky
now that Ram Bharosa has the blue umbrella—a gift from Binya as he tells everyone—he is sometimes persuaded to go out into the sun or the rain and as a result he looks much healthier Sometimes he uses the umbrella to chase away pigs or goats It is always left open outside the shop and anyone who wants to borrow it may do so; and so in a way it has become everyones umbrella It is faded and patchy but it is still the best umbrella in the village People are visiting Ram Bharosas shop again Whenever Bijju or Binya stop for a cup of tea he gives them a little extra milk or sugar They like their tea sweet and milky A few nights ago a bear visited Ram Bharosas shop There had been snow on the higher ranges of the Himalayas and the bear had been finding it difficult to obtain food; so it had come lower down to see what it could pick up near the village That night it scrambled on to the tin roof of Ram Bharosas shop and made off with a huge pumpkin which had been ripening on the roof But in climbing off the roof the bear had lost a claw Next morning Ram Bharosa found the claw just outside the door of his shop He picked it up and put it in his pocket A bears claw was a lucky find A day later when he went into the markettown he took the claw with him and left it with a silversmith giving the craftsman certain instructions The silversmith made a locket for the claw; then he gave it a thin silver chain When Ram Bharosa came again he paid the silversmith ten rupees for his work The days were growing shorter and Binya had to be home a little earlier every evening There was a hungry leopard at large and she couldnt leave the cows out after dark She was hurrying past Ram Bharosas shop when the old man called out to her Binya spare a minute! i want to show you something Binya stepped into the shop What do you think of it asked Ram Bharosa showing her the silver pendant with the claw Its so beautiful said Binya just touching the claw and the silver chain Its a bears claw said Ram Bharosa Thats even luckier than a leopards claw Would you like to have it I have no money said Binya That doesnt matter You gave me the umbrella—i give you the claw! Come lets see what it looks like on you He placed the pendant on Binya and indeed it looked very beautiful on her Ram Bharosa says he will never forget the smile she gave him when she left the shop She was halfway home when she realized she had left the cows behind Neelu Neelu! she called Oh Gori! There was a faint tinkle of bells as the cows came slowly down the mountain path In the distance she could hear her mother and Bijju calling for her She began to sing They heard her singing and knew she was safe and
It is generally agreed that the taproot of the human family shrub is to be found among apelike species of the Middle Miocene Epoch roughly 16–116 mya or Late Miocene Epoch 116–53 mya Genetic data based on molecular clock estimates support a Late Miocene ancestry Various Eurasian and African Miocene primates have been advocated as possible ancestors to the early hominins which came on the scene during the Pliocene Epoch 53–26 mya Though there is no consensus among experts the primates suggested include Kenyapithecus Griphopithecus Dryopithecus Graecopithecus Ouranopithecus Samburupithecus Sahelanthropus and Orrorin Kenyapithecus inhabited Kenya and Griphopithecus lived in central Europe and Turkey from about 16–14 mya Dryopithecus is best known from western and central Europe where it lived from 13 to possibly 8 mya Graecopithecus lived in northern and southern Greece about 9 mya at roughly the same time as Samburupithecus in northern Kenya Sahelanthropus inhabited Chad between 7 and 6 million years ago Orrorin was from central Kenya 6 mya Among these the most likely ancestor of great apes and humans may be either Kenyapithecus or Griphopithecus
Among evolutionary models that stress the Eurasian species some consider Graecopithecus to be ancestral only to the human lineage containing Australopithecus Paranthropus and Homo whereas others entertain the possibility that Graecopithecus is close to the great-ape ancestry of Pan chimpanzees and bonobos and Gorilla as well In the former model Dryopithecus is ancestral to Pan and Gorilla On the other hand others would have Dryopithecus ancestral to Pan and Australopithecus on the way to Homo with Graecopithecus ancestral to Gorilla This morphology-based model mirrors results of some molecular studies which show chimpanzees bonobos and humans to be more closely related to one another than any of them is to gorillas; orangutans Pongo are more distantly related
In a phylogenetic model that emphasizes African Miocene species Samburupithecus is ancestral to Australopithecus Paranthropus and Orrorin and Orrorin begets Au afarensis which is ancestral to Homo
The Miocene Epoch was characterized by major global climatic changes that led to more seasonal conditions with increasingly colder winters north of the Equator By the Late Miocene in many regions inhabited by apelike primates evergreen broad-leaved forests were replaced by open woodlands shrublands grasslands and mosaic habitats sometimes with denser-canopied forests bordering lakes rivers and streams Such diverse environments stimulated novel adaptations involving locomotion in many types of animals including primates In addition there were a larger variety and greater numbers of antelope pigs monkeys giraffes elephants and other animals for adventurous hominins to scavenge and perhaps kill But large cats dogs and hyenas also flourished in the new environments; they not only would provide meat for scavenging hominins but also would compete with and probably prey upon them In any case our ancestors were not strictly or even heavily carnivorous Instead a diet that relied on tough abrasive vegetation including seeds stems nuts fruits leaves and tubers is suggested by primate remains bearing large premolar and molar teeth with thick enamel
Behaviour and morphology associated with locomotion also responded to the shift from arboreal to terrestrial life The development of bipedalism enabled hominins to establish new niches in forests closed woodlands open woodlands and even more open areas over a span of at least 45 million years Indeed obligate terrestrial bipedalism that is the ability and necessity of walking only on the lower limbs is the defining trait required for classification in the human tribe Hominini
This article is a discussion of the broad career of the human tribe from its probable beginnings millions of years ago in the Miocene Epoch 23 million to 53 million years ago [mya] to the development of tool-based and symbolically structured modern human culture only tens of thousands of years ago during the geologically recent Pleistocene Epoch about 26 million to 11700 years ago Particular attention is paid to the fossil evidence for this history and to the principal models of evolution that have gained the most credence in the scientific communitySee the article evolution for a full explanation of evolutionary theory including its main proponents both before and after Darwin its arousal of both resistance and acceptance in society and the scientific tools used to investigate the theory and prove its validity
The primary resource for detailing the path of human evolution will always be fossil specimens Certainly the trove of fossils from Africa and Eurasia indicates that unlike today more than one species of our family has lived at the same time for most of human history The nature of specific fossil specimens and species can be accurately described as can the location where they were found and the period of time when they lived; but questions of how species lived and why they might have either died out or evolved into other species can only be addressed by formulating scenarios albeit scientifically informed ones These scenarios are based on contextual information gleaned from localities where the fossils were collected In devising such scenarios and filling in the human family bush researchers must consult a large and diverse array of fossils and they must also employ refined excavation methods and records geochemical dating techniques and data from other specialized fields such as genetics ecology and paleoecology and ethology animal behaviour—in short all the tools of the multidisciplinary science of paleoanthropology
Human evolution the process by which human beings developed on Earth from now-extinct primates Viewed zoologically we humans are Homo sapiens a culture-bearing upright-walking species that lives on the ground and very likely first evolved in Africa about 315000 years ago We are now the only living members of what many zoologists refer to as the human tribe Hominini but there is abundant fossil evidence to indicate that we were preceded for millions of years by other hominins such as Ardipithecus Australopithecus and other species of Homo and that our species also lived for a time contemporaneously with at least one other member of our genus H neanderthalensis the Neanderthals In addition we and our predecessors have always shared Earth with other apelike primates from the modern-day gorilla to the long-extinct Dryopithecus That we and the extinct hominins are somehow related and that we and the apes both living and extinct are also somehow related is accepted by anthropologists and biologists everywhere Yet the exact nature of our evolutionary relationships has been the subject of debate and investigation since the great British naturalist Charles Darwin published his monumental books On the Origin of Species 1859 and The Descent of Man 1871 Darwin never claimed as some of his Victorian contemporaries insisted he had that man was descended from the apes and modern scientists would view such a statement as a useless simplification—just as they would dismiss any popular notions that a certain extinct species is the missing link between humans and the apes There is theoretically however a common ancestor that existed millions of years ago This ancestral species does not constitute a missing link along a lineage but rather a node for divergence into separate lineages This ancient primate has not been identified and may never be known with certainty because fossil relationships are unclear even within the human lineage which is more recent In fact the human family tree may be better described as a family bush within which it is impossible to connect a full chronological series of species leading to Homo sapiens that experts can agree upon
